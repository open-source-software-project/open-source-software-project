title: Project overview
---

Open Source Software (OSS) is developed, maintained, and extended both within and
outside of the private sector, through the contribution of independent developers as well as people
from universities, government research institutions, businesses, and nonprofits. Despite its ubiquity
and immense use, the extent and impact of OSS is currently unknown; reliable measures of OSS
developed outside of the business sector are scarce. The creation and use of OSS highlight an aspect
of technology diffusion and flow that is not captured in science and technology (S&T) indicators.

Our goal is to discover, collect, and use publicly available non-survey data sources on OSS and to
test the feasibility of developing methods to measure the impact and diffusion of OSS innovation.
We propose (i) to characterize the OSS ecosystem by analyzing available information on OSS
projects (creation and use), and developers (institutions, sectors, and countries); (ii) to represent
the interactions using networks of contributors (through collaborations between developers) and
networks of OSS projects (through reuses across projects and shared contributors) and to analyze
their structural features; (iii) to develop methods to measure the impact of projects and developers
using network-based and OSS-based measures (e.g., downloads); (iv) to study the diffusion of OSS
innovation within and across institutions, sectors and countries; and (v) to bring forward a unique
and novel data product combining various data sources on OSS. The project is high risk because
data availability, collection, and integration can pose a challenge. The project will have a high
reward if our exploratory research is successful as it will provide a paradigm shift in evaluating OSS
through development of rigorous, repeatable, and scalable methods and metrics. Our framework
could apply to other aspects of open science, such as shared data available in public repositories.
